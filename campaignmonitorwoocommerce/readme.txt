Easily subscribe customers to your Campaign Monitor mailing list at checkout.

== Description ==

The Campaign Monitor for WooCommerce plugin allows you to subscribe customers who buy from your store to the Campaign Monitor mailing list. You can then use this mailing list to send campaigns, and setup automated workflows.

Get started with pre-packaged segments. Once you’ve completed the simple integration between Campaign Monitor and WooCommerce, you’ll automatically be setup with pre-built segments, which help you focus your email content on smaller, more targeted groups of subscribers:
	•	High Spending Customers. Keep your biggest spenders engaged and spending with you, perhaps by offering them an exclusive promotion.
	•	Repeat Customers. Recognize and reward your loyal customers with a special email offer.
	•	First time customers. Welcome each new customer in a personalized way, and perhaps offer them a discount on their second purchase.
	•	Newsletter subscribers. Immediately add all newsletter subscribers to your list within Campaign Monitor without any manual effort.
